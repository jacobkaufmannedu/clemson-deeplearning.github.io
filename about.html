      <h1 class="my-4">Clemson Capstone<br /> </h1>
        The Clemson Deep Learning project was one of three projects for the Fall 2017 senior design/capstone. Each Capstone project has a team of students that work in an agile environment to produce a deliverable by the end of the semester. Nvidia gave two Tesla P100 GPU's to the Capstone program to be used for deep learning. 
        The project envoled determining compatible hardware for the GPUs to make a server, researching and finding useful material to help others get started and to create two interesting showcases that uses deep learning. While waiting on the parts for the server, our team did installation of deep learning frameworks and the showcases on Caleb's Nvidia workstation.

        <b>Angelo Carrabba</b><br/>
        I chose this project because I wanted to learn about deep learning in depth and the math behind it. I finalized the hardware recommendations for the server and created the Google DeepDream showcase.

        <b>Emilie Whitesell</b><br/>
        I heard about deep learning because I was interested in autonomous driving but I wanted to know what else deep learning was capable of and how it worked. I set up Jupyter Notebook on the workstation and created the Deep Learning website.

        <b>Jake Roose</b><br/>
        I wanted to understand how this revolutionary technology works so that I can help apply it to different fields. I worked on creating the interactive aspect of the colorization showcase and implemented an image recognition CNN.

        <b>Jacob Kaufmann</b><br/>
        I believe most of the technological innovation that will occur in my lifetime will be a result of AI. I served as the team representative, installed multiple frameworks on the workstation including Caffe and DIGITS, and researched trends/applications in deep learning.

        I wanted to learn more about deep learning because it is one of the most popular trends in computer science right now. I created the Colorization project with having a grayscale image input and getting a colored image as output.
